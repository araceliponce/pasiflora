          <p>Yes, indoor plants do need fertilizer, but the frequency of fertilization depends on the type of plant and the time of year. During the growing season, most indoor plants will benefit from monthly fertilization with a balanced fertilizer. During the winter months, when growth slows down, fertilization can be reduced or stopped.</p>

          How can I control pests on my indoor plants?
        </button>
      </h3>

        <div class="accordion-body">
          <p>The best way to control pests is to prevent them from getting on your plants in the first place. Inspect new plants carefully before bringing them indoors and isolate them from other plants for a few days to ensure they're pest-free. If you do have pests, try using insecticidal soap or neem oil, which are both safe and effective for indoor plants.</p>

          How can I tell if my plant needs more light?

        <div class="accordion-body">
          <p>If your plant isn't getting enough light, it may begin to droop, lose leaves, or become leggy. You can also check the color of the leaves â€“ if they're pale or yellow, the plant may not be getting enough light. On the other hand, if the leaves are turning brown or crispy, it may be getting too much light.</p>
